# Docker for Beginners - Linux

In these three exercises, you'll learn the basics of Docker running on Linux. These labs are heavy on teaching the core concepts of Docker and are a great place to start learning Docker.

* [Part One: Your First Linux Containers](part-one.md): In this lab you will explore the basics of running containers: pulling images from a registry, running a containerized application, and container instances and isolation.

* [Part Two: Customizing Docker Images](part-two.md): Move on to building your own custom Docker images and explore the Docker concept of image layers and the Dockerfile.

* [Deploy and Managing Multiple Containers](part-three.md): Real apps consist of multiple components. In this lab, you will begin to explore running multiple services as a single stack with Docker Swarm.
